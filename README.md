## Acknowledgements
 - deficient [@deficient](https://github.com/deficient) for the [volume indicator+control widget for awesome](https://github.com/deficient/volume-control) - I've tried a lot of volume indicators for awesome but this one is the best. Minimal, but functional.

## Installation

Execute install.sh as sudo from a terminal:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/debian-awesome.git
 cd debian-awesome/
 sudo /.install.sh
```

For those who would like a single-line command:
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/shreyas-a-s/debian-awesome.git && cd debian-awesome/ && sudo ./install.sh
```
